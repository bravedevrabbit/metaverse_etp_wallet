The wallet Service Provider will not store users’ wallet private keys, mnemonics or backup words (collectively, “private key information”) in any centralized database. Users’ private key information and files generated through importing private keys belong solely to the person who created the wallet account. The user bears the responsibility to safeguard his/her private key files and password and is solely responsible for the use of his/her account, password and private key information.",
        "LIST_INTRODUCTION": "You agree that the wallet service provider will not bear any responsibility in the following situations:",
        "LIST_ITEM_1": "Leaks of personal information due to the user having made known his wallet password/private key information to others, the user not having safeguarded his/her password/private key information, the user having shared his/her wallet account, or any other mistakes that are not committed by the wallet Service Provider.",
        "LIST_ITEM_2": "The use of this service involves internet services and may be affected by unstable connections. The use of this service entails the risk of service disruptions or services being unable to meet the demands of users due to the following: events of force majeure, malware, viruses and other malicious software, attacks by hackers, unstable operating systems, users’ geographical location, users shutting down their devices and other reasons related to the internet, technology and telecommunication lines. Users must understand and undertake the above risks. The wallet service provider will not be responsible for any consequences resulting from the use of this service.",
        "LIST_ITEM_3": "The use of asset transfer services is based on users having sufficient knowledge about the counterparty (including but not limited to the counterparty’s real-world identity). There is no way to recall, revoke or undo asset transfers once they have been executed. Users will undertake all risks resulting from the use of asset transfer services once they have executed a transfer. The wallet service provider shall have no legal responsibility for any disputes that arise due to asset transfers. These disputes will be resolved by the sending and receiving parties.",

        "BRIEF_EXPLAIN": "MyETPWallet.com makes it easy for you to create, save, and access your information and assets and interact with the Metaverse blockchain. You are solely responsible for managing your funds and for maintaining the security of your private Key and any mnemonic passphrase (‘backup words’) associated with your wallet.",
        "WARNING": "Before using this wallet, please be aware that there are important risks associated with cryptocurrency and blockchain-based open-source software such as large exchange rate fluctuations and software bugs. By registering an account through MyETPWallet.com or MVSD, you agree that you have read, understood and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this disclaimer.",
        "I_TITLE": "I. Accessing and Controlling wallet Information",
        "I_INFO": "1.1 When you create a wallet account, it generates a mnemonic passphrase (‘backup words’) consisting of 24 English words and a public and private keypair used to send and receive digital currency. You must backup your mnemonic passphrase and private key information and keep it secure; failure to do so may result in the loss of control of the assets within your wallet.",
        "I_INFO_2": "1.2 The wallet does not collect or store any of our users’ private information, including your password and private keys. This information is stored locally on the user’s own device. Hence, we cannot assist you with wallet retrieval. The Development Team is only responsible for guaranteeing wallet access and fixing software bugs, and is unable to restore encrypted private keys or otherwise recover private keys. If you use MyETPWallet.com, you acknowledge that Metaverse is not responsible for safeguarding or maintaining private keys associated with the wallet. We strongly advise you to back up your wallet files to best protect your property rights.",
        "II_TITLE": "II. Wallet Security",
        "II_INFO_1": "2.1 The Metaverse Team will implement appropriate security measures to protect users against data loss, inappropriate use, unauthorized access and/or disclosure. For example, we implement high-standard encryption techniques such as SSL to protect your personal information. Please be advised that we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any data you disclose online, due to technical limitations and unforeseeable hostile actions against the platform. By using our service, the user acknowledges the possibility that the system and telecommunication network they use to access our service can be compromised, which is out of our control. For instance, the software the user has downloaded or websites visited may contain viruses or malwares that threaten the security of the wallet information. Therefore, it is imperative that users ensure the security of their personal information and data. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence. The development team recommends that users pay special attention to backing up password and private keys offline (e.g. writing them on a piece of paper).",
        "II_INFO_2": "2.2 Under no circumstances should users trust information originating from non-official sources. Any wallet operation should only take place after the user has completed due diligence and assessed the counterparty’s identity.",
        "II_INFO_3": "2.3 It is the sole responsibility of the user to protect their wallet security. The developers from the Metaverse Team will take appropriate technical measures in accordance with industry standards to protect data security on the user’s device but are not legally responsible of any data or funds loss. In those circumstances, the user acknowledges and agrees that the Metaverse Team does not guarantee the complete safety of the wallet funds.",
